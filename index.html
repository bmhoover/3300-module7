        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          According to PEW Research, 96% of adults between 18-29 occasionally
          consult reviews before making a purchase. But does this mean that
          higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically, what do
          higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher ratings
          lead to more game sales. But could some more obscure games with a
          dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than popular games
          with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has
          been an increase in the production of games in recent years and, if
          so, what effect this increase has on the quality of games based on
          review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games
          results in review scores decreasing with the oversaturation of video
          game releases?
        </p>

        <p>
          In this project, I plan to use Metacritic’s user and critic review
          scores to see if there is a correlation between the scores of a game
          and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales
          data obtained from VGChartz.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="data">
        <h2>2. Data</h2>

        <p>
          This project uses two primary sources of data: Metacritic’s game
          critic and game player review scores of different games and VGChartz
          data about video game sales.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>

        <p>
          I collected data from Metacritic, which contained user (user score)
          and critic (meta score) review scores for each game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Metacritic’s data was found on 186 different web pages. I wrote a web
          crawling script to collect all data across these 186 pages. I
          collected the game title, summary, platform, user score, meta score,
          and release date for 18,526 games. Some of the results were the same
          game that was released on different platforms, which is essential to
          consider when I begin merging the data. I created a data frame which
          is contained in the Metacritic.csv file in the project folder. The web
          crawling script that I wrote is contained in the metacritic.R file in
          the project folder.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data didn’t need much cleaning; however, to make the platform
          match with the VGChartz data, I created a dictionary to convert
          Metacritic’s platform data to match VGChartz. This cleaning was done
          in the file combining_vgs.R.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Video Game Sales</h3>

        <p>
          The website VGChartz provides sales data about the number of units of
          each game/platform combination sold.
        </p>

        <p>
          The information was contained in 1,249 web pages. Due to the extensive
          nature of the data, I decided to break the web crawling results into
          six different CSV files (VGChartz_0 – 5.csv), all contained in the
          project folder. The web crawling script is contained in the vgchartz.R
          file in the project folder.
        </p>

        <p>
          I collected the game, platform, release date, publisher, and sales
          data from PAL, Japan, and North America as well as total game sales
          for 62,398 games. Like the Metacritic data, some of these games were
          released on multiple platforms, which count as a unique observation in
          the data. Another interesting thing to note is that series were
          counted in this data frame alongside their individual counterparts.
          For example, Super Mario is counted as a series, but each entry in the
          series is also contained in the dataset. This was handled in the
          cleaning of the data.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Combining Reviews and Sales</h3>

        <p>
          Since both data sets included the same game title multiple times based
          on the platform, I had to merge based on both the game title and
          platform. Both data sets are also vastly different in the number of
          observations. I decided to create two separate data sets in merging.
          One data set is the intersection of the data and only contains data
          that appears in both data sets. The other data set, called the union,
          contains all rows from both data sets. All this work was done in the
          combining_vgs.R file in the project folder.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the differentiator between both data frames is their number of
          rows and most of my cleaning was regarding the columns, I created a
          function to iterate over both data sets to clean them. This cleaning
          included trimming the white space on the summary and publisher,
          turning the sales data into numeric, and adding the platform,
          publisher, and title as factors. I also turned all the release dates
          into a “Month, Year” format and combined the release date from
          VGChartz and Metacritic into one column. Next, I dropped all sales
          data except North America sales and total sales. I also dropped the
          extra release date column, and the index columns. I exported these
          datasets to VGSales_union.csv and VGSales_intersect.csv, respectively.
          The union had 68,288 observations, and the intersect had 12,288
          observations.

        <h2>3. Analysis</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Video Game Ratings and Sales</h3>

        <p>
          I wanted to find out whether games with higher reviews sell more and
          navigate the relationship between the different types of sales and
          review scores. I started by calculating correlation coefficients to
          explore the relationship between variables. There was a correlation
          coefficient of .954 between the total sales and North American sales.
          This is evidence of an extremely strong correlation between these two
          variables. North American sales make up 48.7% of the total sales,
          which is a significant reason for this strong correlation. However,
          the correlation between sales and review scores was very weak. The
          correlation coefficient between total sales and meta score was .248,
          and it was .102 between total sales and user score. While there was a
          moderate correlation between user score and meta score at .524, it is
          nowhere near as strong as it was between the two sales variables.
        </p>

        <p>
          I first thought this weaker correlation might be due to the difference
          in rating scales between the two groups of people. To prove this was
          not the case, I created a boxplot of the two scores, using ggplot.
          This plot is shown in Figure 1. While there might be slight
          differences in the interquartile range, the medians of the two
          variables are the same. However, taking the difference between their
          means results in a value of 1.67, which is somewhat significant. A
          histogram that compares the two variables, such as the one in Figure
          2, gives us a good insight into the reason behind the difference in
          means. We can see that the meta scores have much higher counts of high
          reviews, while the user score has a greater number of low reviews.
          This may be part of the reason why the meta score has a slightly
          better correlation with sales than the user score.
        </p>

        <p>
          The meta score is a better predictor of sales than the user score.
          While the correlation isn’t very strong, it does exist. There is some
          basis for the reason behind this correlation. Many companies send out
          review copies to critics in hopes that the reviews will boost sales.
          Critics usually publish their review scores in the days before a game
          is released. This increases excitement around the game before the
          general release date benefitting both the video game company and the
          critic.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the correlation appears to show that there probably isn’t as
          much benefit in this manufacturer-critic relationship as the
          manufacturer would like. I initially thought the weak correlation
          might be due to the large number of games with little sales. I
          recalculated the correlation coefficient between meta score and total
          sales which produced even less of a correlation at .065. While high
          review scores may help a company’s reputation, they do not correlate
          well with more sales.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Video Game Publishers</h3>

        <p>
          To find out which video game publishers have the highest sales, I
          created a summary data frame, publisher_df, which was grouped by the
          publisher. In this data frame, I included the ratings’ average, the
          sales’ sum, and the number of games each publisher has released. To
          find the publishers with the highest sales, I took a slice_max of the
          data frame based on the total sales. The result appears in Table 2.
          The information is also saved in the publisher_sales.csv file in the
          project folder.
        </p>

        <p>
          I noticed that all but one publisher released at least 800 games. I
          calculated the correlation between the total sales and the number of
          games a publisher had released. The coefficient of correlation between
          these two variables was .715, which demonstrates a strong correlation
          between the number of games released and the total sales of a
          publisher. Because of this strong correlation, I thought creating a
          scatterplot between the two variables would be useful to analyze the
          data further. The scatterplot can be seen in Figure 3 below.
        </p>

        <p>
          This correlation does not apply to the number of games released and
          the publisher’s average meta score. The correlation coefficient
          between these two variables is -.013, which is evidence of no
          relationship between the number of games released and the average meta
          score.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Release Date</h3>

        <p>
          To determine how sales, number of games released, and review scores
          have changed, I created a data frame called by_month, which grouped
          the games by month and calculated the average review scores, the sum
          of sales, and the number of games. To make the dates easier to use in
          a scatterplot, I decided to change the data type to date format. I did
          this by setting the column as a date with the day value being the
          first day of the month the game was released.
        </p>

        <p>
          To start my analysis, I wanted to see if there is an increase in the
          number of games being developed over time. The correlation coefficient
          between the release date and the number of games released is .533,
          which is evidence of some correlation, but it is not especially
          strong. Next, I created a plot of the number of games released in
          relation to the date. I also compared the total sales of games over
          time, using the patchwork package, to see if there was a clear pattern
          between the number of games released and total sales.
        </p>

        <p>
          Figure 5 reveals a large peak in the number of games released around
          2010 before decreasing again. The sales of games did not see this same
          spike. The purchase of games released after 2010 remained somewhat
          consistent, unlike the number of games released in that same period.
          The increase in games around the late 2000s is likely due to the
          release of new video game consoles that reached many mainstream
          markets. Many video game consoles could also play Blu-ray discs and
          had multimedia features, which increased their popularity.
        </p>

        <p>
          To further analyze sales, I looked at how the passage of time has
          affected sales globally versus in North America. The correlation
          coefficient between total sales and the release date is .273, much
          lower than for the number of games released and the release date. This
          also holds for the correlation between North American sales and the
          release date, which has a correlation coefficient of .229.
